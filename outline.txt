Saman wants a "story" for motivating thesis.  Tell the story of developing two
clients: an instruction counting client, and a memory alignment client.

How about an opcodemix client?  This is actually easy to optimize the trivial
implementation of.  For every instr, insert call to increment array element
indexed by argument of opcode enum.  Inline, fold lea, bam.  Con: requires
re-running benchmarks.

- What do I need in background?
  - What does DR offer a tool writer?
  - BB-by-BB exec model
  - App context vs. DR context
  - Roughly how to switch contexts
  - Discuss scratch space and OS TLS concerns

Possible outline:

- Introduction.
  - Tell story of tools, why they are good, examples of what they can do.  Tell
    story of writing instruction count client.

- Background on DynamoRIO
  - Benefits for tool writers:
    - Provides abstract representation of machine instructions as bbs executed,
      allows tool to insert its own instructions as instrumentation.
    - Maintains control for tool, even in face of SMC, JITs, execution from
      stack, complex Windows desktop apps using OS resources, etc.
    - DR provides transparency, helps hide tool operations from application,
      Ex must use alternate stack.
  - Execution model
    - Two contexts: application context and dynamorio context, separate stacks
    - Basic block interpretation: appstart, from first instr to next CTI
    - Terminating CTI is mangled to return control to DR
    - Modified basic block is encoded into a "fragment" in the "code cache"
    - DR switches to app context in fragment, fragment switches to DR context
      when finished.
    - DR examines app context, determines app's target PC, interprets next basic
      block.
    - Finally, basic blocks with direct CTIs are "linked" to eliminate any
      context switches from code paths executed more than once.

- Inlining
  - Describe instruction count
  - Clean calls
  - Inlined calls
  - Coalesced calls: Remove register save/restore pairs between calls
  - Use TLS
  - RLE/DSE
  - Avoid aflags
  - Fold leas

- Partial inlining
  - alignment & memtrace: describe structure of common fast path, alude to
    similar technique in our fasttrack race detector.
  - Clean Calls with Arguments: argument materialization
  - Decoding the routine in the presence of control flow
  - Handling Fastpath: describe detection of and isolation of fastpath
  - Handling Slowpath: describe expansion of slowpath
  - Handling Side Effects: describe how side effects are deferred in memtrace
    example
  - Constant Folding (immediate arguments)
  - Complex lea Folding

- Performance
  - inscount
  - alignment
  - memtrace
  - comparison with Pin?

- Future or related work?
  - Alternative: Predicate Function: discuss Pin's approach of InsertIfCall +
    InsertThenCall, inline IfCall if possible.  Requires client code
    restructuring, but doesn't suffer from above issues.
