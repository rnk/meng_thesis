Main features:
* Stacked bars of 9+ datasets
* Clustered bars of 8+ datasets
* Clusters of stacked bars
* Lets you keep your data in table format, or separated but listed in
  the same file, rather than requiring each dataset to be in a separate file
* Custom gnuplot command pass-through for fine-grained customization
   without having a separate tool chain step outside the script
* Color control
* Font face control and limited font size control
* Automatic arithmetic or harmonic mean calculation
* Automatic legend creation
* Automatic sorting, including sorting into SPEC CPU 2000 integer and 
  floating point benchmark groups

Multiple data sets can either be separated by =multi,
  or in a table with =table.  Does support incomplete datasets,
  but issues warning.
For clusters of stacked bars, separate your stacked data for each
  cluster with =multi or place in a table, and separate (and optionally
  name) each cluster with multimulti=
