\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

This thesis was made possible with the help of many individuals.  First and
foremost, Saman Amarasinghe, my advisor, has provided me with the guidance
needed to complete the project, for which I am grateful.  I also want to thank
him for making 6.035, the MIT undergraduate compilers course, as rigorous and
practical as it was.  Derek Bruening also deserves much credit for being the
driving force behind DynamoRIO.  Working closely on DynamoRIO, I have learned
more and more about the transparency and performance challenges that it faces
and how they have been overcome.  Qin Zhao, another contributor to DynamoRIO,
has helped me a great deal through conversation about the implementation details
of the system.  Qin is also responsible for the initial inlining prototype,
which I have been working steadily to improve.  I have learned something new
after every one of our conversations.

On a more personal note, I thank my parents for everything they have given me.
To my father, I have always enjoyed our conversations, technical and otherwise.
To my mother, I am ultimately thankful for the time you have spent encouraging
me to achieve.
